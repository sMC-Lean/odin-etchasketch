# odin-etchasketch

penultimate project as part pf TOP foundations course;

the goal of the project is to create a grid of squares that can draw in the spirit of an old etch a sketch;
It designed for us to practice html and css using flexbox as well as manipulating the DOM and events using JS;

My idea was to build it as if it is in sand, adding the ability to gradually darken the colour as if you are dragging your finger to draw;
